# Ignorance is Strength


## Introduction

Hi. My name is Paul Infield-Harm.

I work at Cyrus Innovation, which is an awesome consulting company based in NYC. We help startups and enterprises make great software.

I'm here today to talk about RubyMotion. This is something of a chronicle of the personal journey I've taken getting to know it. I hope that by the end of it, you'll have an opinion about whether you'd like to take a path. I've got a few things for you to leave with: some recommendations for things to use or read, source code from this talk, and an open door to talk with me offline.

This will be mostly a monologue with slides. But if there's something that you don't understand, either because I was unintelligible or I'm explaining it poorly, please ask me then and there. Otherwise, please jot down your comments until the end, when we'll have ample time for questions and discussion.

Can you hear me in the back? Can everybody see me and the screen? Great! Let's start, shall we?

## Prologue

If you're of a certain age, and you think about Apple, there's an ad that probably comes to mind.

No, its not the "I'm an Apple" ads. Its this one:

Here's what the man on the screen is saying

	Today, we celebrate the first glorious anniversary of the Information Purification Directives. We have created, for the first time in all history, a garden of pure ideology. Where each worker may bloom secure from the pests of contradictory and confusing truths. Our Unification of Thoughts is more powerful a weapon than any fleet or army on earth. We are one people, with one will, one resolve, one cause. Our enemies shall talk themselves to death and we will bury them with their own confusion. We shall prevail!

This, of course, is an homage to the novel *1984* by George Orwell. In particular, it refers to one of the three slogans of Ingsoc, the ruling party of Oceania, the superstate in which the novel is set. They are

WAR IS PEACE

FREEDOM IS SLAVERY

IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH

## Starting cold

Download the rubymotion installer. Install it. Do a bunch of xcode things. Complain about the additional cost of developer licenses. Oh well.

Make a new project, call it foo. Here is what it looks like. What's all this then? How do I start? I feel like I am alone in the world.

## Do the tutorial, stupid



## Rewriting Objective-C

So, one thing that you're going to have to do, unavoidably, is learn to rewrite Objective-C code into RubyMotion code. 

Here's what you'll have to do

[Take some sample code and rewrite it]

Take a look at the rubymotion page to learn more about this.

Rewriting objective-c code into Rubymotion is something that you're going to do a lot, and it really underscores a problem with minoirty languages in general.
