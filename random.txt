Here's where you are, roughly speaking. There's something in the world called "RubyMotion" that you heard about somewhere. Personally, I read about it on Hacker News when Laurent Sansonetti first announced it. I bought a copy of it. I got it on sale, but now it costs $199.99, which is kind of a stupid looking price in my opinion.

A first question you might ask is: is it worth to plunk down $199.99 to buy this piece of software, based on whatever articles you've read. This is a hard question, and the answer depends on your budget and needs.

- The Apple Developer license costs $99 / year. You still need to do this.
- You need to have an Apple computer to work on, which will cost a few thousand dollars.
- You also probably need some devices, which cost some more.

So, from a hard costs perspective, RubyMotion doesn't add that much more to the cost of development.

Life would be really awesome if the RubyMotion folks could figure out how to give away the product and sell support or something. But it is what it is.
